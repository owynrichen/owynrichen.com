# Why Post This?

This post is for me to personally collect my thoughts on key aspects of how I approach technical
leadership so I can more effectively talk about it when asked.

[TOC]

# Leadership Style(s)

I periodically refresh my perspective on styles by re-reading [Leadership that Gets Results](https://hbr.org/2000/03/leadership-that-gets-results).
It's 25 years old at this point, but a lot of the perspective is relevant today. The key thing that remains
true is that leadership styles are tools that should be used for the best purpose.

As defined by that framework, my 'default' styles are a blend of the 'authoritative' and 'coaching' styles.
I also have some 'affiliative' style sprinkled in. In times of crisis (like operational issues) I can unbox
the 'coercive' style, but my preferred approach there is to setup system for teams to react to crises at
pace without me, and target mitigating crises altogether.

Specifically:
- As a part of strategy development, planning and goal-setting, I wrap that into a vision and
push to get the organization on-board with it.
- I focus on setting up systems that delegate authority and accountability downward in a consistent way.
- I help teams and individuals through feedback and support, coaching them towards optimal output.
- I naturally care about people and their wellbeing so I include that, but not at the expense of progress.
    - I call this 'compassionate directness'.

# Setting (and Evolving) Strategy

## TLDR;

1. Assess the business needs and how to win
2. Define the plan to get there and how to measure success
3. Roll it out and review

## More Detail

1. Understand the business dreams for 5 years, goals for 3 years, and needs for 1 year
    1. Gather input from business/product stakeholders and the market
    2. Gather input from technology stakeholders (tech leadership, CISO, legal/governance/compliance)
    3. Gather input from the engineering team (team pain points, assess maturity)

2. Define (or partner to define) the plan and roadmap to get there, and how to measure progress/success
    1. Keeping metrics focused on chief business movers and chief constraints, 4-6 *total*

3. Roll out the strategy and establish a cadence for communication and progress review as well as a caendance for iteration/improvement of the strategy
    1. Review OKRs with the team regularly (monthly at minimum) to reinforce importance
    2. Evaluate the OKRs quarterly and iterate if needed
    3. Evaluate the stategy annually and iterate if needed
    4. Reward the team for exemplary work

## Strategic Change Agents in 2024/2025

1. AI, it's benefits and disruptions
2. US Administration and Policy changes
3. Corporate return-to-work policies
4. Continued economic pressure

# How to Drive Work

1. Develop roadmap prioritized by business strategy, as measured by OKRs
2. Establish capacity assignment targets towards roadmap vs. KLO/tech-debt (85/15)
    1. Make sure the team's work process is setup to capture this data with low overhead (tickets/reports)
    2. Ensure roadmap-centric tasks are prioritized and reviewed constantly
    3. Ensure KLO/debt is aligned to development principles (security SLAs, unit tests, automation, etc)
3 Review on a regular basis and tweak (bi-weekly)

# Driving to Engineering Maturity

TODO - talk about DORA/DevSecOps/etc
talk about constraint management and goals/maturity assessments
